    contText: `Sync originated from the 'Bennett Carpooling' WhatsApp group at Bennett University, where students coordinated carpools, shared information, and bought and sold items. As the group's admin, you recognized the need for a more organized platform to enhance these interactions.

    Inspired by the group's success, you envisioned Sync as a mobile app that would streamline carpooling and incorporate marketplace and announcement features tailored to university students.

    With a dedicated team of developers, you set out to create an intuitive app that addresses the unique challenges faced by college students, providing a convenient, affordable, and sustainable transportation solution. Sync transformed from a simple WhatsApp group into an essential resource for the university community, showcasing the power of grassroots innovation.`,
