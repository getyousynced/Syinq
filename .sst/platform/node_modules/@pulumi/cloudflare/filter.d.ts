/**
 * Filter expressions that can be referenced across multiple features,
 * e.g. Firewall Rules. See [what is a filter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/api/cf-filters/what-is-a-filter/)
 * for more details and available fields and operators.
 *
 * > `cloudflare.Filter` is in a deprecation phase until January 15th, 2025.
 *   During this time period, this resource is still fully
 *   supported but you are strongly advised to move to the
 *   `cloudflare.Ruleset` resource. Full details can be found in the
 *   developer documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudflare from "@pulumi/cloudflare";
 *
 * const wordpress = new cloudflare.Filter("wordpress", {
 *     zoneId: "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711",
 *     description: "Wordpress break-in attempts that are outside of the office",
 *     expression: "(http.request.uri.path ~ \".*wp-login.php\" or http.request.uri.path ~ \".*xmlrpc.php\") and ip.src ne 192.0.2.1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import cloudflare:index/filter:Filter example <zone_id>/<filter_id>
 * ```
