/**
 * Provides a Cloudflare rate limit resource for a given zone. This can
 * be used to limit the traffic you receive zone-wide, or matching more
 * specific types of requests/responses.
 *
 * > `cloudflare.RateLimit` is in a deprecation phase until January 15th, 2025.
 *   During this time period, this resource is still
 *   fully supported but you are strongly advised to move to the
 *   `cloudflare.Ruleset` resource. Full details can be found in the
 *   developer documentation.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as cloudflare from "@pulumi/cloudflare";
 *
 * const example = new cloudflare.RateLimit("example", {
 *     zoneId: "0da42c8d2132a9ddaf714f9e7c920711",
 *     threshold: 2000,
 *     period: 2,
 *     match: {
 *         request: {
 *             urlPattern: `${cloudflareZone}/*`,
 *             schemes: [
 *                 "HTTP",
 *                 "HTTPS",

 *             headers: [
 *                 {

 *                 },
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     },
 *     action: {
 *         mode: "simulate",
 *         timeout: 43200,
 *         response: {
 *             contentType: "text/plain",
 *             body: "custom response body",
 *         },
